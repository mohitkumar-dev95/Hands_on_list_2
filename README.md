# System Software-II Lab Programs

## 📌 Description
This repository contains implementations of **System Software-II** lab exercises.  
It covers:
- Timers (ITIMER_REAL, ITIMER_VIRTUAL, ITIMER_PROF)  
- Resource limits (getrlimit, setrlimit)  
- Signals handling (signal, sigaction)  
- Process management (orphan process, kill, exec, fork)  
- Inter-Process Communication (Pipes, FIFO, Message Queues, Shared Memory, Semaphores)  
- Threads & synchronization  
- Socket programming (client-server communication, concurrent servers)  

## 📂 Structure
Each lab exercise is implemented as a separate C program file for clarity and modularity.
